# Password project

the following project was created in an effort to meet the following criteria:

-GIVEN I need a new, secure password

-WHEN I click the button to generate a password

-THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria

-WHEN prompted for password criteria

-THEN I select which criteria to include in the password

-WHEN prompted for the length of the password

-THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters

-WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password

-THEN I choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters

-WHEN I answer each prompt

-THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected

-WHEN all prompts are answered

-THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria

-WHEN the password is generated

-THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page

multiple variables were created with connections to functions that contained FOR loops as well as IF ELSE statements to allow more specific circumstances for the users convenience. the following code will allow various passwords to be generated based off of specific parameters provided by the user.
